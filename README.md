#Choose Your Own Adventure Game

A console program that lets a user take part in a text based adventure. These adventures are similar to the [“Choose Your Own Adventure” books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) that were popular in the 1980s and 1990s.

The idea behind a “Choose Your Own Adventure” book is for the reader to become the protagonist in a story. The reader is presented with several choices to make and the story will change based on your decisions. Here is some example text from an adventure (user selections are in green):
